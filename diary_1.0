**Diary Entry, Age 10**

4th of Frostfall, 4E 168

Dear Diary,

Today the castle was really cold, like it's winter but it's not. The wind whistled through the corridors and made everything feel ghostly. Dad seemed really grumpy. He didn't even look at me when I said 'good morning.' Mom told me not to worry, that Dad has lots of big things to think about. I wish he wasn't always so serious. I like it when he smiles. It's been a while since I've seen that.

When I was playing outside, I found a little bird. Its wing was hurt, and it couldn't fly. I felt sad for it. So, I've decided I'm going to take care of it and help it get better. I've made a little bed for it with some cloth in my room. The poor thing looks so fragile, but its eyes are full of life. I think I’ll name it 'Hope'.

Mom said it was a good idea to take care of the bird. She always knows how to make me feel better. She promised to help me with it, and even showed me how to clean its wounds. Mom is always so kind, even if she’s busy with her 'secret studies' that Dad says are important but a distraction sometimes.

I hope that when Dad sees the bird and how I'm helping it, he might smile. I just want him to be happy like he used to be. Maybe the bird will make him forget his big important things for a little while. I remember when he taught me about all the herbs in the garden, and he smiled so much then. I miss that.

I’m going to check on Hope again before bed. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day.

**Diary Entry, Age 11, Birthday**

13th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 169

Dear Diary,

Today was my birthday! It was a special day. Mom made a big cake, it was so yummy and had my favorite frosting on it—vanilla with just a hint of lemon, and decorated with little sugar flowers. I got to wear my prettiest dress, the one Mom made for me with the red ribbons, and everyone in the castle said 'Happy Birthday' to me. Even the cooks and guards were extra nice.

Dad gave me a really neat present. It was a small, shiny stone that sparkled like the stars. He said it was a magic stone. He didn't explain what kind of magic exactly, but he said it would always protect me, and that it's very special, just like me. I've never had anything like it before. I'm going to keep it safe in my treasure box, right next to my favorite shell and the little doll Mom made for me last year.

We had a big dinner and I got to sit at the head of the table, like I was the queen of the castle! It was so much fun. There were lots of dishes, like roasted venison with juniper berries and the freshest vegetables from our garden. Everyone was laughing and telling stories, even Dad, who seemed happier than usual. He told me a funny story about a clumsy bard who came to the castle once. Even Mom giggled at that one!

When it was time to blow out the candles on my cake, I made a secret wish. Mom said wishes come true if you believe in them. I hope mine does. I'm keeping it close to my heart.

I wish every day could be like today, with cake and presents and everyone being happy. Birthdays are the best days ever! I hope when I grow up, I can make other people feel as special as I did today.

**Diary Entry, Age 12**

20th of First Seed, 4E 170

Dear Diary,

Dad's been having really long meetings lately. He talks in a quiet voice with some men I don't know. They look serious and kind of scary, with their dark robes and intense eyes. Whenever I pass by the room, I can feel the heavy air around them. Mom seems to be worried a lot when they talk. I can see it on her face, even when she tries to smile at me.

I heard them say something about 'greater power' and 'eternal life.' I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds really scary. It made me feel a bit afraid. I don't like it when they talk about stuff like that. I tried asking Mom, but she told me not to worry and that it’s just something grown-ups have to deal with. But her eyes didn’t match her words.

I remember when I was littler, things weren't so complicated. Dad wasn't always in meetings, and Mom wasn't worried all the time. We used to laugh together, play games in the castle courtyard, and have picnics by the lake. Everything felt so simple and safe.

Now, it feels like there's something dark coming, something that I can't see but can almost feel. I wish it could be like that again. Just simple and not scary. Just us being happy.

Mom tried to cheer me up today by making my favorite stew. It was nice, but I could tell her mind was somewhere else. She kept looking out the window, even though there was nothing but the forest and the evening mist.

I hope these strange times pass soon. I miss the days when the castle felt warm and full of love, not cold and full of secrets.

**Diary Entry, Age 13, Swordsmanship**

1st of Second Seed, 4E 171

Dear Diary,

Today was intense – Dad decided it's time I learned how to handle a sword. He says it's essential for someone in our family to know how to defend themselves. I've never been much for fighting, but Dad seemed serious about it. He said a time may come when I have to protect myself, and he wants me to be ready.

The training was in the castle courtyard. The sun was bright, and every now and then, a cool breeze would flutter through our capes. Dad was showing me how to hold the sword, how to stand, and all that. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be. The sword felt heavy in my hands, and I kept messing up the stances he was trying to teach me.

Dad was patient, though. He corrected my grip and showed me the basic moves over and over. I got frustrated a few times, and my arms felt like they were going to fall off, but he kept encouraging me. He said that everyone starts out as a novice, even him. I could see a glimmer of pride in his eyes when he talked about his own training days.

There was this moment when I actually got one of the moves right, and Dad smiled. He said I have potential. That felt good, hearing it from him. It's not often that Dad gets into teaching mode like this. Usually, he's all caught up in his lordly duties and the mysterious meetings we still have around the castle.

After the training, Mom found us and brought some cool water. She looked at me with a mix of worry and pride, telling me I did well. Her touch was gentle as she wiped the sweat from my brow. It made me feel both protected and capable.

I'm exhausted now, but in a good way. It's weird, but I kind of enjoyed the training by the end. There's something satisfying about pushing through the difficulty and feeling a little stronger each time. Maybe next time, I won't be so clumsy with it. I think I might actually be looking forward to learning more. Who knows, I might just get the hang of this sword-fighting thing.

**Diary Entry, Age 13**

15th of Midyear, 4E 171

Dear Diary,

Dad called me in for a serious talk today. He was all about the big plans and destiny of our family. He kept saying how we're meant for something huge, chosen by some ancient power. The way he talked about it made it seem like our family's pretty important, like really big-deal stuff. His eyes had this intense fire, like nothing in the world could shake his conviction.

Mom was there too, just standing next to him. She didn't say much, just watched and listened. It's hard to tell what she's thinking sometimes. She had this look, like she's always figuring things out, staying quiet about it. She didn't seem as into the whole 'destiny' thing as Dad, but she didn't disagree either. It felt like she was there to support him, even if her own thoughts might be different.

Listening to Dad go on about our family ruling over stuff and gaining all this power was kind of intense. Part of me gets caught up in it – like, what if it's true and we're really meant for something epic? What if our lives will change the world? But then I look at Mom, and I'm not so sure. She's like this puzzle I can't solve, always holding back her true thoughts, her true feelings. It's like she wants to protect me from something.

I feel like we're on the edge of something really big, like our family's about to step into the spotlight or something. Dad's totally convinced we're destined for greatness. But with Mom being so quiet and mysterious about it, I'm not sure what to think. She’s the one I'm used to turning to when I'm confused, but now she’s part of what’s confusing me.

What's my part in all this? I'm just trying to figure out where I fit into their plans and what all this 'destiny' talk really means for me. Dad seems to believe there's a special role for me in this grand scheme. But I still feel like I'm just figuring things out, still trying to understand who I am in this big, complicated world.

Anyway, I guess I’ll have to wait and see what happens next. Maybe things will get clearer with time, or maybe I'll find my own answers to these big questions. For now, I'll just keep doing my best, learning all I can, and trying to stay strong.

**Diary Entry, Age 14**

8th of Last Seed, 4E 172

Dear Diary,

Mom called me into her room today for something totally unexpected – she wanted to teach me about alchemy. It wasn't like our normal mother-daughter stuff; this was more like serious training. She was all business, showing me all these herbs and potions, but I could tell there was more to it than just teaching me a lesson. There was a sense of urgency in her voice and a depth in her eyes that I hadn’t noticed before.

She kept saying how understanding life and death is key to our family's power. The way she talked about it, it was intense, like every little detail was part of something bigger she's trying to get me ready for. It was like she was entrusting me with a piece of our legacy, something ancient and profound.

We spent the time mixing stuff and talking about the different plants. She knows so much about how they can heal you or hurt you, depending on what you do with them. It's like she was letting me in on some big secrets, not just about making potions but about what our family is really about. The way she spoke about the properties of each ingredient, how they interacted, and their myriad uses—it was like she was revealing a hidden language to me.

Dad and his big ideas weren't even brought up. This was just about me and her, and the things she knows. For a little while, it felt like we were really connecting, more than just regular mother-daughter stuff. It was like she was giving me a piece of our family's story, something about being strong and making it through tough times. Mom’s wisdom felt like a guiding light in the dark uncertainties surrounding our family.

Before I left, she gave me this vial of potion we made. 'For protection,' she said. It might seem like a small thing, but it felt like a big deal, like she was giving me something more important than just a potion. It's hard to explain, but it felt like a moment that mattered. As if in that vial, she had not just placed ingredients, but also her hopes and her love, a tangible reminder of our bond.

I tucked the vial safely away, feeling a mix of emotions. Maybe this is the start of understanding more about our family’s true nature and my place in it. Perhaps one day, I’ll uncover all the layers of these lessons and their deeper meanings. For now, I’m grateful for the time with Mom and the knowledge she shared.

**Diary Entry, Age 14, First Taste of Cyrodilic Brandy**

22nd of Sun's Dusk, 4E 172

Dear Diary,

Dinner tonight was different. Dad let me try a bit of Cyrodilic brandy. He said it was for a special occasion. I wasn't sure what the occasion was, but when I took that first sip, it felt like being part of something grown-up and significant. The brandy was kind of sweet and made me feel warm, but also a bit dizzy. For a little while, Dad was laughing and joking, and it felt like things were lighter, like back when things weren't so serious all the time.

For those moments, it was like the weight of the world had lifted off his shoulders. He told funny stories from when he was young, and Mom even joined in with a few of her own. Their laughter filled the dining hall, and it almost felt magical, like a memory from a different, happier time.

But then, like a switch, everything went back to normal. Dad got all serious again, talking about what our family is supposed to do and all the big things we're meant for. It was like this heavy cloud came back over us, taking away the fun we just had. His tone grew darker, talking about our legacy, our responsibilities, and the power we're destined to hold.

Now I'm in my room, and I can’t stop thinking about how nice it was to just laugh and not worry about all this destiny stuff. I wish we could have more times like that, just being happy and not always caught up in all these big plans and responsibilities. There’s something special about those moments of simplicity, of just being together without the burden of our family's expectations hanging over us.

Why does everything have to be about power and what we're 'supposed' to become? I miss when things were simpler, when we could just enjoy being together without all this weight on our shoulders. It feels like ages since we've had a day free of plotting and planning for our future. It’s suffocating sometimes, this constant push towards some grand destiny.

I wish we could have more of those light, happy moments, not just these rare glimpses. Sometimes I wonder if Mom feels the same way, if she misses the days when we could just be a family without the shadows of 'greater power' and 'eternal life' looming over us. Maybe, just maybe, tomorrow might bring another one of those rare, bright moments.

**Diary Entry, Age 15**

5th of Hearthfire, 4E 173

Dear Diary,

This week has been really strange. We had some guests visiting Father—important people, or at least that's how he made it seem. They arrived a few nights ago, dressed in fine robes and speaking in hushed, serious tones. Each evening, the dining hall was filled with their voices, their laughter blending with the melodies of a friendly bard who had come to entertain.

Father seemed pleased with their company, more animated than I've seen him in a while. He even let them try our finest wine, the kind he usually reserves for special occasions. Despite the grandeur, something felt off. The guests would often cast curious glances my way, and their eyes had this strange glint I didn’t quite understand.

One morning, I woke up early for some reason and decided to go for a walk before breakfast. As I passed by the guests' rooms, I couldn’t help but notice that their doors were slightly ajar. It struck me as odd; they were particular about their privacy. I peeked inside out of curiosity and saw that their belongings were still there—clothing, travel bags, and personal items, everything left as if they had casually stepped out for a moment.

When I reached the great hall, I discovered that the guests were gone. Vanished as if into thin air. No word, no goodbye. Just—nothing. I asked the servants, but they seemed confused too. They suggested that perhaps the guests had left early for an important errand. But something doesn’t feel right.

I told Mom about it, and she just nodded, her face calm but her eyes worried. She said that things are often not what they seem and that sometimes people leave without a trace. There was a steely edge in her voice, as if she knew more than she was willing to share.

Father didn’t mention their leaving at all. When I brought it up during breakfast, he changed the subject quickly, almost too quickly. It was like asking him was an intrusion into something deeply private and secret. For the rest of the day, there was an eerie silence around the castle, a quiet that felt too thick and heavy.

**Diary Entry, Age 16**

27th of Rain's Hand, 4E 174

Dear Diary,

Today was kind of strange. Dad – I mean, Father – called me to his study. It was all formal and serious. The way he greeted me, it instantly felt different, like this wasn’t going to be the usual talk. He started telling me about our family's history, how long and powerful our lineage is, and how important it is for me to understand our place in the world.

He spoke about our ancestors, our heritage, and the influence we've always wielded. It was like being in a quiet storm, with all these heavy words swirling around me. It felt more like one of those lessons that are more about duty than anything else. I tried to concentrate, but my mind kept drifting to simpler times when we could talk about anything, and his eyes were softer.

Then, out of nowhere, he said I should stop calling him 'Dad.' He wants me to call him 'Father' or 'Lord Harkon' from now on. Hearing that felt like a punch to the gut. He said it's time I start behaving more like a member of our esteemed family and less like a child. That hit me kind of hard, like he was drawing a line between us that hadn't been there before. It’s like he’s pushing me to grow up faster, to become this person I'm not sure I’m ready to be.

The rest of the talk was a blur. Every word bounced off my ears as I kept thinking about how he doesn't want to be 'Dad' anymore. It’s as if he’s building this invisible wall, transforming into this figure of authority rather than the father I used to know. I understand that I’m not a little kid anymore, and maybe he feels it’s necessary, but it still hurts.

When our conversation ended, I left his study with a heavy heart. As I write this now, I'm struggling to process how I feel. It’s like he’s preparing me for something enormous, something beyond just family stories and history. But why does growing up have to mean losing the dad I used to know?

I long for those days when his role was simply to guide and protect, unburdened by the weight of titles and expectations. It feels like a part of my childhood is slipping away, being replaced by something cold and distant. Maybe one day, I’ll understand and accept this change, but for now, it’s just really confusing and sad.

I wish growing up didn’t have to mean changing how I see the people I love. I wish I could keep calling him Dad, and still be part of the great destiny he sees for our family.

**Diary Entry, Age 16**

28th of Rain's Hand, 4E 174

Today was... unimaginable. I still can’t fully grasp what happened. If I don’t write it down, I feel like my mind will shatter trying to make sense of it.

Father summoned me early this morning, not to his study but to a hidden chamber beneath the castle. I'd never been there. The air felt thick with ancient, dark energy, and the walls were lined with old texts and artifacts.

Father stood inside a ritual circle, waiting. He said it was time for me to understand another aspect of our family's power. Before I could ask what he meant, he presented a lifeless body on a stone slab. It was cold and unnerving.

He began teaching me an ancient spell to raise the dead. Every word, every motion felt heavy. Following his instructions, I recited the incantation, and the body began to move, to breathe. As the corpse rose, awe and dread rippled through me.

I asked who the person was. Father looked at me coldly and said, “Nobody.”

It was successful. We had raised the dead. Then, Father handed me a dagger. His voice was stern, “Power requires sacrifices and discipline.” He commanded me to kill the newly-raised person. My hands trembled as I held the dagger, barely able to breathe.

Father's grip tightened around my wrist. “I am waiting,” he said impatiently. With fear and a desperate need to prove myself, I did it. I plunged the dagger into the man's heart.

He collapsed, lifeless once more, as my heart shattered alongside him. The room filled with unbearable silence.

I returned to my room feeling numb and lost. The dagger lies hidden away, but I can’t escape the memory of its weight, the man's eyes.

**Diary Entry, Age 18**

19th of Evening Star, 4E 176

Dear Diary,

Today was one of the darkest days I can remember. It began a few days ago when Father caught some servants stealing from us. He decided that it was time for me to oversee a trial and pass judgment. Initially, I felt a strange excitement—it seemed like a chance to prove my responsibility.

But the day before the trial, Father and Mother called me into the study. They explained that for such an action, the only fitting punishment was death. I tried to argue, to suggest another way, but Father was firm. He said that stealing from nobles is different than from common folk, that it undermines authority and cannot be tolerated.

I was terrified, but Father’s stern eyes left no room for debate. Mother stood silent but resolute beside him. Her silence cut deeper than words, a silent endorsement of Father’s harsh decree.

During the trial, I could barely function. The grand hall felt suffocating, filled with the weight of expectations and my silent dread. The servants—two young men—stood trembling before me, eyes wide with fear and pleading. I wanted to scream, to refuse, but the intensity of Father's gaze held me mute.

When the trial reached its climax, Father asked for my judgment. Every eye in the hall turned to me, but all I felt was the oppressive weight of their stares. My voice trembled as I tried to speak, fear and confusion swirling in my mind. With fumbling hesitation, I managed to utter the word, “Death.”

The room fell silent, and my heart shattered in the deafening quiet. The look of despair in the servants’ eyes will haunt me forever. I can barely remember what happened after that. It’s all a blur of faces and muted sounds.

Now, sitting alone in my room, I feel an overwhelming emptiness. Father seemed proud, but I feel as if I’ve lost a part of myself. The weight of that decision bears down on me, and I wonder if this is what power truly means: making choices that tear at your soul.

**Diary Entry, Age 18**

30th of Sun’s Dusk, 4E 176

Dear Diary,

Today was nothing short of a nightmare. Father—Lord Harkon—asked me to accompany his soldiers to a nearby village. He said we needed “workers,” but the way he pronounced that word made my skin crawl. The tone in his voice left no room for debate. 

Mother was nowhere to be found, and that only heightened my unease. I wondered if she knew what was about to happen, but I couldn’t dwell on it. We set out almost immediately, and my mind churned with dread during the entire journey.

When we reached the small fishing village, the soldiers demanded ten workers from the villagers. Silence hung heavy in the air as no one volunteered. Tension quickly escalated. One soldier tried to drag a man forward, and chaos erupted as others attacked with swords and clubs. The villagers fought back in panic and desperation.

Amid the commotion, I found myself stepping away, hoping to distance myself from the violence. Suddenly, an older villager cornered me. His eyes were wild with fear and fury, and I drew my sword, pleading with him to leave me alone. My voice trembled, betraying my terror. He ignored my pleas and lunged at me.

Reflex took over, and in sheer panic, I defended myself. My sword pierced his chest, and as he fell, I felt the warmth of his blood splatter onto my hands. I stood there, staring at his lifeless body, paralyzed by the shock of what I had done. My first kill, and it left me hollow and shaking.

One of Father’s soldiers found me, shaking me back to awareness. He pulled me away from the gruesome scene, and we made our way back to the castle in a heavy silence.

Upon our return, Lord Harkon seemed pleased. The soldier recounted the events, and Father raised a toast, pride glinting in his eyes. The triumph in his voice contrasted sharply with the anguish gripping my heart. I felt sick, my stomach churning at the celebration of such a horrific act.

I’ve never felt so lost, so conflicted. I killed a man today with my own hands, and I don’t know how to reconcile that with who I thought I was. The weight of his lifeless body, the look in his eyes as life faded—it’s all burned into my memory.

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

4th of First Seed, 4E 178

Dear Diary,

For the past year, Father has been collecting workers again. Groups of them come to the castle, but they seem to disappear not long after. I don't even want to know what's happening to them, but it's impossible to ignore the growing emptiness of the nearby village. Once a vibrant place, it now feels haunted by absence.

Mother tries to reassure me, saying there's a war and that the villagers have probably fled to safety somewhere. But somehow, I doubt that's true. Her words feel hollow, lacking the conviction I need to believe her. Sometimes, her eyes betray a deeper, unspoken truth that chills me to the bone.

Today, at dinner, something terrible happened. I accidentally called him "Dad" at the table. The casual slip felt natural in the moment, like reaching for a memory of simpler times. But his reaction was immediate and fierce. His eyes flashed with anger, and before I could even process it, he slapped me across the face.

The shock of it numbed me. I stood up and left the table without a word, the sting of his slap radiating down to my very core. I could feel everyone's eyes on me as I walked away, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to escape the constricting atmosphere, to find solace in my own space.

Now, in the quiet of my room, I'm trying to make sense of everything. The man who once protected and guided me is now a source of fear and confusion. The father I used to know feels like a distant memory, replaced by Lord Harkon—a figure of authority and cold ambition.

How did we get here? How did I become a piece in his grand, dark plans? The more I try to fit into my role, the more lost I feel. There's a part of me that still yearns for the connection we had, for the family we used to be. But with every passing day, that hope seems more naive, more unattainable.

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

15th of Frostfall, 4E 178

Recent nights in the castle have been awash with secret gatherings and unfamiliar visitors. Each evening, Father convenes with these enigmatic figures in hushed whispers, their motives shrouded in the secrecy of twilight. There's an energy about him now, a fervor that suggests his plans are nearing fruition.

In the hidden corners of the castle, I often see strangers, their faces marked by confusion and apprehension. Father insists they are integral to our family's grand designs, vital cogs set to elevate our name to unprecedented heights. I endeavor not to ponder too deeply on their fates. Father's intricate schemes are beyond my comprehension, and I trust he knows the course he charts.

Mother drifts through these days like a specter, her face giving away nothing. Yet, our silent encounters in the corridors are laden with unspoken understandings. Her gaze sometimes betrays a hint of something deeper—maybe resignation or a quiet readiness for the events to come.

They've been whispering about some very important event, something monumental, I gather. Though they speak in hushed tones, the gravity of their words is unmistakable.

As for myself, I take refuge in my arcane studies, immersing myself in the lore and rituals of our lineage. They offer a semblance of stability, a distraction from the burgeoning questions that haunt me. What is the role I am to play in Father's grand tapestry of ambition? These thoughts remain cloaked in the recesses of my mind, unvoiced amidst the grandeur and mystery of our family's legacy.

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

18th of Frostfall, 4E 178

Dear Diary,

A few days have passed since the strange guests arrived and the air in the castle grew thick with anticipation. Today, Father and Mother finally shared their plans. We, as a family, are to perform a ritual for Molag Bal. They explained that this would grant us undreamed-of power and that I should be proud of our destiny.

When I asked who would participate, I already knew the answer but hoped for a different one. Tears welled up in my eyes and I screamed, "Valerica! Do you know what Molag Bal will do to us?" She remained calm, her expression unchanged, and explained that it was a small price for the gift we would receive.

Their words echoed in my mind—power, destiny, pride. But all I could think of was the dread of the ritual, the horrifying tales I’ve read about Molag Bal’s dark influence.

The castle feels like a cage now, its walls closing in with the weight of what’s to come. I’ve thought about escaping, running far away where their plans can’t reach me. But doubts plague me—what if they’re right? What if this is something worth enduring, a destiny I can’t deny?

I feel torn between my fear and the loyalty I’ve always had for my family. The thought of the power they speak of is alluring, but at what cost? How much of myself am I willing to give up?

These thoughts swirl in my mind, leaving me restless and fearful. I wish there was someone to guide me, to help me see through this darkness. For now, I’ll stay, but uncertainty gnaws at my heart. The ritual draws near, and with it, the unknown.

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

20th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 178

Dear Diary,

Tonight, the castle's shadowed corridors bore witness to an unsettling event. One of the guests, someone Father had secreted away, managed to break free from his confines. Emerging from the darkness with eyes wild with fear and desperation, he mistook me for one of his jailers. His attack was frantic, driven by fear more than malice.

My response was swift, almost reflexive. In a fleeting struggle, he fell motionless to the ground. I stood there, a mix of shock and disbelief washing over me as eerie quiet settled in. The guards arrived promptly, efficiently erasing all traces of the encounter. Their murmurs about the prisoner's fate – "another one for the Lord" – lingered in the air, but I pushed the implications away.

Initially, I was shocked by what happened. But once the initial shock wore off, I realized something unsettling: I didn't feel any remorse or pity for the man. His death seemed like just another inevitable part of the twisted reality we live in.

This month before the ritual feels like a dark prelude, each day drawing me closer to something I both dread and question. The castle has become a labyrinth of shadows and secrets, each corner holding its own hidden fears.

Father and Mother's voices echo in my mind, their talk of power and destiny mingling with the memories of tonight. What awaits us with Molag Bal's ritual, and what are we truly sacrificing in pursuit of this dark promise?

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

20th of Evening Star, 4E 178 - Morning of the Ritual Day

Dear Diary,

The day has arrived—the day of Molag Bal's summoning. The castle has been a frantic buzz of activity over the last few days, but today, everything feels heightened, heavy with anticipation and dread.

This morning, Mother summoned me. Her demeanor was as controlled as ever, her calmness chilling. With an unsettling detachment, she unfolded the details of the ritual—our transformation into the Daughters of Coldharbour. It was as if she were discussing a mere procedure rather than an event that would redefine our very existence.

She spoke of the ritual with a familiarity that was disconcerting. Her explanation hinted at a profound invasion of our beings, a violation not just of our spirits but our corporeal forms as well. The ritual, she said, was not only a transformation but a relinquishing of ourselves to a force ancient and fearsome.

Mother's gaze was unwavering as she detailed the steps we would undergo, an undercurrent of something unspoken in her tone. It was as if she was preparing me for an ordeal that went beyond physical endurance, a harrowing surrender of our bodies to a power both terrifying and alluring.

The concept of this transformation, while darkly intriguing, carries an implicit horror. To become a Daughter of Coldharbour is to accept a fate where the very sanctity of one's physical self is breached by an entity whose desires are beyond human comprehension.

As we prepare for the ritual tonight, Mother's words weigh heavily upon me. There's a part of me drawn to the immense power promised by this ritual, yet I cannot ignore the ominous reality of what we are to endure. This path we are to walk is one of immense power, but it comes at the cost of a most intimate and profound violation, a price that both terrifies and entices me.

The castle feels like a living entity itself today, pulsating with an ancient energy. Even the stones seem to hum with anticipation. As dusk approaches, I find myself standing at the precipice of a transformation that will fundamentally alter who I am—who we are as a family.

I can't help but feel a profound sense of loss intertwined with the promise of power. If there is a way to hold on to my sense of self while embracing the darkness ahead, I hope I find it. Tonight, we step into the unknown, and nothing will ever be the same.

**Diary Entry, Age 20**

20th of Evening Star, 4E 178 - Right Before the Ritual

I'm trying to write my last thoughts as I am now. I can't shake this feeling, this... doubt. I've always been sure, but now I'm not. The weight of what we're about to do presses down on me, making it hard to breathe.

They're calling me, it's time. I have to go, but what if—

**Diary Entry, After the Ritual**

21st of Evening Star, 4E 178

I've awakened into this new, dark existence. The memories of the ritual linger in my mind, fragments of a nightmare I desperately try to forget. Yet, some images remain vividly clear, haunting me with their intensity. Among them, the most unsettling is the memory of Mother during the ritual—her face was eerily calm, a stark contrast to the chaos around us.

As I attempt to piece together the events of that night, I find myself continually drawn back to that image. Her serenity in the midst of our transformation was jarring. It wasn't the reaction I expected, not in those moments of horror. Why was she so composed when everything else was unraveling? This question gnaws at me, adding a layer of confusion to an already tumultuous time.

Now, as a vampire, I feel a sense of power and a deep connection to the night. The world seems different, distant in a way. Yet, I can't shake off the memories of the ritual, no matter how hard I try. I want to leave them behind, to fully embrace my new nature without the burden of these haunting images.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that Mother's demeanor might hold deeper meaning—perhaps a level of acceptance or understanding that I have yet to grasp. It's as if she was prepared for this, in a way that I was not.

As I write this, I'm still wrestling with these thoughts, trying to reconcile the memory of Mother's tranquil expression with the violent reality of what we endured. It's a stark reminder of the complexities of our new existence and the enigmatic nature of the path we now walk.

Power and darkness, these are my new companions. But with them come questions—about myself, about my family, and about the sacrifices we made. I hope that in time, I'll come to understand more. For now, I must live with the shadows of that night, and the new, terrible strength that courses through my veins.

This morning, as I tried to write my thoughts, I accidentally broke a feather quill in my trembling hands. Everything feels different now. I can't stop looking at my fangs, a constant reminder of the change that has taken place. They feel foreign, yet I know they are now a part of me.

A servant came by to check on me, and I couldn't help but notice how delicious they smelled. I told myself it was just hunger for food, but the thought lingered longer than it should have. I shudder to think of the implications.

I'm not fully recovered, far from it. Each moment seems surreal, as if I'm navigating through a fog of unfamiliar sensations and emotions. The power promised to us feels more like a curse right now. As I continue to adjust, I wonder if I'll ever find clarity amidst this newfound darkness.

 **Shortly After Becoming a Vampire, Age 20**

7th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 179

I've begun to notice the changes, the new realities of this form I now inhabit. Today, a startling revelation—I don't need to breathe. It was an accidental discovery. Lost in thought, I suddenly realized I hadn't taken a breath in hours, perhaps the entire day.

I witnessed Father and Mother transforming into some kind of night creature they call a Vampire Lord. They spoke of it with an unsettling reverence, as if that grotesque form is somehow respectable. When they asked me to try to transform, I was unable to. I was too weak. They quickly figured out that I haven't yet fed.

I've been delaying feeding, holding onto a semblance of my former self. But I feel like soon I will have to cross this bridge. Father has insisted that he wants to witness my first time feeding. I'm sure this is a punishment for my avoidance, and he will provide prey that will be some twisted idea of a lesson for me.

The thought chills me, but the mounting hunger is becoming impossible to ignore. How much longer can I keep my resolve before the need overwhelms me? The days of avoidance are dwindling, and soon, I'll have to face the reality of what I am.

**First Feeding, Age 20**

7th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 179 - Evening

Father came to me this evening and told me to follow him. He led me to the castle's depths, where the thralls are kept. The very air smelled of blood and decay, a chilling reminder of what I was about to do.

When we arrived, I recognized the thrall—it was my servant from my earlier years. Her eyes met mine with a sad recognition. Father explained that they have no need for such servants, especially those who refuse to join his blood court.

Trying to steady myself, I approached her. My hands trembled as I attempted to bite into her neck artery, but I missed and tore it apart instead. Blood gushed out, and she collapsed, her life spilling onto the cold stone floor. Father's laughter echoed around me, mocking me for my apparent hunger.

When it was done, I stepped back and realized I had completely ruined my dress, now soaked and stained with her blood.

As I sit here, writing this, I wonder if I ever felt any human emotions at all. The horror of my actions is dulled by this new, overwhelming hunger and the cold detachment that has begun to take hold. Is this what I am now, what I've become?

 **100 years, are we family? Age 120**

20th of First Seed, 4E 278

A century has passed since I became what I am now. Time feels different as a vampire; it flows in a way that's hard to grasp, yet I am acutely aware of its passage. Tonight, as I sit in the quiet of my chamber, my thoughts turn to my family—what we were and what we've become.

So much has changed over the decades. The castle, once echoing with the ambitions and intrigues of my family, now holds an atmosphere of eerie stillness. I wonder about us, about what ties us together anymore. Are we still a family in the true sense, or has time and our nature eroded that bond into something unrecognizable?

Father, with his eternal schemes for power, seems more distant than ever. Our conversations, once filled with shared plans and teachings, are now rare and formal. There's a coldness there, an unyielding focus on our roles as vampires rather than any familial connection. His eyes, once a source of guidance, now only reflect ambition and calculation.

And Mother, ever enigmatic, has retreated further into her own pursuits. The understanding and warmth we once shared seem veiled now, obscured by the years and our individual experiences. She moves through the castle like a shadow, her motives as inscrutable as ever. Occasionally, her gaze hints at the woman she once was, but those moments are fleeting.

As for myself, I feel adrift in these changes. The certainty I once held about our family's purpose and unity has given way to questions. What does it mean to be a family when you're bound not just by blood, but by the very essence of vampirism? Is our connection merely a remnant of a past life, something we cling to out of habit or necessity?

I ponder these things as I wander the halls of our ancient home, feeling both a part of it and apart from it. The ties that bind us are complex, intertwined with our individual desires and the nature of our existence. Are we still a family, or have we become something else entirely—a pact of predators bound by shared immortality rather than kinship?

As I close this entry, the night calls to me, a reminder of the eternal life I lead. The hunt, the blood, the dark allure of power—they are constants in my existence. But even amidst the certainty of immortality, the question of my family remains—an unresolved, lingering thought in the depths of my timeless existence.

**Diary Entry, Age 320**

20th of Evening Star, 4E 578

It's been centuries since I last put quill to parchment in this diary. The pages, once a refuge for my thoughts and experiences, have remained untouched, gathering the dust of ages. Tonight, I find myself wondering about the purpose of continuing this old habit. Is there a point in chronicling an existence that stretches endlessly before me?

The world outside these castle walls has changed in ways both subtle and profound. Yet, in many ways, I remain as I was—a spectator to the passing of eras, a constant in an ever-changing tapestry. The routines of my vampiric life have become so ingrained that each night feels much like the last, a cycle of hunting, brooding, and the occasional intrigue.

My family, once the anchor of my existence, now feels like a distant memory. Father's relentless pursuit of power has rendered him more a figure of legend than a parent. Mother, lost in her own enigmatic world, is like a ghost I occasionally cross paths with. The bond of family, once so pivotal, now feels like a tenuous thread in the fabric of my unending life.

As I reflect on these centuries, I question the purpose of recording my thoughts. What value is there in documenting an existence that feels increasingly solitary and unchanging? These diary entries, once a solace, now feel like echoes of a past self, a reminder of a time when I felt more... human.

Yet, here I am, writing once more. Perhaps there's a part of me that clings to this ritual as a connection to who I once was—a young vampire grappling with her new identity, trying to make sense of an eternal life. Maybe, in some way, continuing this diary is an acknowledgment of that part of me that still yearns for understanding, for a sense of purpose in the endless night.

The hunt remains the same—thrilling, necessary, but increasingly hollow. The blood of mortals sustains me, yet their lives pass so quickly, like flickers of light in a vast, dark expanse. In the face of such ephemeral existence, it’s hard to find meaning.

As I set down my quill, I realize that while the act of writing may seem futile in the face of eternity, it remains a link to my past—to a time when every discovery and emotion felt new and significant. Perhaps one day, these entries will serve as a reminder of the journey I've undertaken, a testament to the enduring nature of thought and memory, even in the life of a vampire.

For now, I continue, not out of necessity, but out of an ancient, almost forgotten longing for purpose, for connection. The pages may yellow and the ink may fade, but the act of writing endures, much like my ceaseless existence.

**Diary Entry, Age 320**

21st of Evening Star, 4E 578

Father has become even more deranged. His obsession with his death and the Elder Scroll's prophecy consumes him. It's terrifying to see how far he's fallen into this madness.

I haven't seen Mother in years; she's vanished into her own shadows. And as for myself, I can't stay here any longer.

The castle is no longer my refuge. I need to go. Now. Before it's too late.
